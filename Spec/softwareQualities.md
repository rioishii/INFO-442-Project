# Software Qualities
Below is a ranking of software qualities we value in ths project:

1. Usefulness - the extent to which software solves a problem
    * Our software has to come off as being extremely useful in order for actual usage
2. User efficiency - the speed with which a person can perform tasks with a program
    * This is important because if user action was slow, it would be like doing another chore
3. Consistency - extent to which related functionality in a  system leverages the same skills, rather than requiring new skills to learn how to use
    * This software has to be really easy to use
4. Correctness - extent to which program behaves according to specification
    * Important such that the user doesn't get unexpected behavior
5. Reliability - extent to which program behaves the same over time in same environment
    * If the software crashes this will turn off the user from using it
6. Performance - extent to which a program uses resources economically (i.e. is it fast?)
    * This software should be something that the user can pick up easily and use right away. Any lag time will seem like a chore
