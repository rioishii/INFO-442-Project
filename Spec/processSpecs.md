# Specifying our Process

- How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or contexts.
  - We will use Facebook Messenger to communicate with the team, and use the @user function when time is of the essence. The @user function will also be utilized when questions are geared towards the managers of a component in question. Facebook Messenger is used by all of us multiple times an hour, which makes it the most efficient way to communicate with each other. The added ability to send attachments within the chat is also another feature that makes messenger a vital tool for us to use in communicating ideas.
  
- What coordination and planning practices will you follow? Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.
  - We have all-group meetings every Wednesday after lecture, and have partial meetings on Sundays. The agenda of Wednesday meetings are to decide what should be due the coming week for sprints and classwork. The agenda on Sunday will be to assess if we’re on track with the goals we defined on Wednesday, and allocate time and work accordingly to work on any weak points addressed during this meeting.
  - We’ve used when2meet.com to figure out when we’re free on each day of the week, so we know that Sundays and Wednesdays work the best for us.
  - If any components of our software are causing complication, meetings will be held over Google Hangouts immediately if most members are not physically together. These ad hoc meetings will be held in the early evenings because that’s when we’re all free.
  
- Who will own each of the components in your architecture? Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.
  - Signup/Login: Benny, Chris, Bradley
    - Benny and Bradley have created sign up and authentication webpages using React, Firebase, or Django. Their flexible skill set in creating these webpages combined with Chris’ UX and design experience is necessary for this component.
  - User Database: Jessica
    - Jessica is in charge of the database because of her experience in the database courses UW as well as the tools we plan to use for our database.
  - Dashboard: Jessica, Chris, Bradley
    - Jessica and Chris have design experience with extracurriculars in addition to the design methods they’ve learned in class. Bradley has similar experience, however he has more extensive experience in web development using Django, Bootstrap, and other additional frameworks. Together, they’ll combine the components of the dashboard to design a fluid UX experience.
  - Chore Database: Jessica
    - Jessica is in charge of the database because of her experience in the database courses UW as well as the tools we plan to use for our database.
  - ChoreHandler: Benny and Rio
    - Benny and Rio are experienced software developers in React and Javascript along with knowing the basic principles of asynchronous programming. It’s necessary to have these two on this as the software will be using these tools frequently.
  - UserHandler: Benny and Rio

- By what date will you have a release candidate?
  - We will have a release candidate by week 7, before the sprint starts. Specifically, by Thursday May 16th. We’ve chosen this date so that we have something to work off of before sprints start. While our code will most likely be buggy, the sprints will help in polishing that. Another approach we thought of was to work on a feature each sprint until we create our final release candidate, however do to time constraints we found that working on our project this other way is more efficient. It’s more efficient because all of our class workloads are pretty heavy, so working hard on each feature would give us setbacks. We rather work very hard on the key features in the beginning, and then easily polish bugs through the sprints. Utilizing the next three weeks of the quarter towards sprints, we’ll polish this application to be fit for release outside of a classroom setting.

- What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?
  - Committing to GitHub and testing other people's components will show that we’re making progress towards the release candidate.
  - As the end of the quarter comes, we should start seeing more and more pull requests to show that our components are ready to be merged. These pull requests need to be approved by people outside of the component being merged so that the whole team knows what’s going on and what the code means. From this, we’ll know that our release candidate is making progress because our components are starting to come together.
  - We’ll go over in our Wednesday meetings if we’re on track or have completed the goals set from the week before. If we’re consistently making progress / have no roadblocks, then we’re making progress.
  
- What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?
  - We will hold a team meeting to rearrange who works on each component and adjust our resources (such as people and time) accordingly. It may be that some people have strengths and weaknesses we didn’t specifically address before, so it will be during this time we improvise and adjust our resources based on those strengths and weaknesses we dismissed before.
