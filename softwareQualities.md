# Software Qualities
Below is a ranking of software qualities we value in ths project:

1. Usefulness
    * Our software has to come off as being extremely useful in order for actual usage
2. User efficiency
    * This is important because if user action was slow, it would be like doing another chore
3. Consistency
    * This software has to be really easy to use
4. Correctness
    * Important such that the user doesn't get unexpected behavior
5. Reliability
    * If the software crashes this will turn off the user from using it
6. Performance
    * This software should be something that the user can pick up easily and use right away. Any lag time will seem like a chore
