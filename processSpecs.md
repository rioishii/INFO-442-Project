- How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or contexts.
  We will use Facebook Messenger to communicate with the team, and use the @user function when time is of the essence. 

- What coordination and planning practices will you follow? Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.
  We have all-group meetings every Wednesday after section, and have partial meetings on Sundays.

- Who will own each of the components in your architecture? Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.


- By what date will you have a release candidate?
  We will have a release candidate by week 7, before the sprint starts.

- What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?
  Committing to GitHub and testing other people's components.

- What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?
  We will hold a team meeting to rearrange who works on each component and adjust our resources (such as people and time) accordingly.
