## Problem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When living in a shared spaces, it is often difficult to manage tasks for house chores. What becomes of this is an unfair division of tasks. Additionally, some shirk their responsibilities onto other roommates who cannot tolerate dirty dishes, not vacuuming common space, and taking out trash. Since the days in which people have been living with one another, these struggles have always been present. It is no wonder that college students, who often rent out or dorm with strangers or acquaintances, get their fair share of arguments relating to unfinished chores.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[A study done by Arizona State University](https://phys.org/news/2013-11-division-household-chores-mess-tolerance.html) cites that the division of labor is due to the fact that people have differing levels of tolerance threshold. The higher one's tolerance threshold, the longer they'll hold off on completing a task until it reaches a crisis points. Oppositely, the lower one's threshold means they will likely take action before others in doing a chore. Another factor that made undone chores a burden was a student's living situation, which heightened the severity of the problem.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living situation during college is a very tense environment. As most students entering a university setting are likely to live at local dorms, it can be seen that chores piled up is likely to cause quarrels. Sara Sanchez, who [studied the experiences of Freshman year living arrangements](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=cehsedaddiss), found that roommates were most of the negative experiences during that year. She notes that in one instance that one roommate had lashed out to the other about doing chores, and quickly ruined their relationship for the rest of the year.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one can see, division of labor is a problem in a collegiate environment. Unfinished chores can build up, and subsequently diminish connections with others. Everyone has their own varying levels of a tolerance threshold that does not mesh well with those they live with.
